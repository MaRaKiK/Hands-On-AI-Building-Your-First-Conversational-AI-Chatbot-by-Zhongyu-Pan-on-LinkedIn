# 🤖 Conversational AI Chatbot  
🚀 This project was built as part of the course **“Hands-On AI: Building Your First Conversational AI Chatbot”**.  
It demonstrates how to **fine-tune a pretrained model** with Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch, and then deploy it with **Gradio** for an interactive user interface.  

👉 **You could try it live here:** [Chatbot on Hugging Face Spaces](https://marakik-mychatbot.hf.space/?__theme=system&deep_link=qiN96PVBrJY)

## ✨ Features  
- 🔹 Fine-tuned a **pretrained Hugging Face model** for conversational AI  
- 🔹 Preprocessing and tokenizing of dialogue datasets  
- 🔹 Training & evaluation using Hugging Face’s **Trainer API**  
- 🔹 **Gradio-based web UI** for easy interaction  
- 🔹 Deployable on **Hugging Face Spaces**
